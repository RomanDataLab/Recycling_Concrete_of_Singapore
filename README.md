# Recycling_Concrete_of_Singapore
## Research of urban mining and strategy of the circular construction industry for Singapore. </br>
team: Reda Petravičiūtė, Naohiro Miyaguchi, Roman Pomazan</br>

The project strategically targets public housing as a place of densification and a source of urban mining, aiming to solve the problem of upcoming precast concrete waste. Therefore a circular micro-district design proposal is created, focusing on processes (new circular hubs, proximity of material distribution), materials (pre-cast modules with upcycled materials) and environment (bioclimatic conditions improvement), applied both in district and city scale. </br>
tools: Grasshopper (Rhinoceros 3d 7), Hops, EarthEngine, Geojson, Json, Scikit-learn, QGIS, illustrator, Photoshop, Urbano, Wallacey, Shrimp, Decoding Spaces.

## Questions
- what are strategic objectives of Singapore as a state to sustain the high-competitive economy in the future?
- how strategic objectives correlate with current construction cycle policies and goals of non-carbon future?
- what could be changed in the policy-making of Singapore to meet the GLobal goals of circular economy?

## What I learned: 
- Data mining with Earth Engine, Json and OSMNX.
- Data cleaning and preparation.
- Data creation with Scikit-learn.
- Data vizualisation for analysis.
- Generation of scenarios of neighborhood renovation applying the evolutional ML of Wallacey.
- Methods of overlappind map data with Grasshopper and QGIS.
- Methodology-development of scientific research project.
- Map generation with Networkx, OSMNX, Geopandas.
- Processing of complex-layered maps.
- Merging BIM and GIS to ETL

## Key takeaways
- Singapore resolves the housing issue by a unique approach of maintaining the Lion's part of public-funded residences that are leased for 100 years.
- Dominating part of construction materials consists of different states of concrete.
- Singapore is one of the main hubs of concrete processing i.e. importer of concrete aggregates, and the main innovation hub for reused concrete upcycling.
- In 40-60 years the majority of concrete housings will meet the challenge of outdated level of zero-carbon embedded emissions.
- Singapore develops and implements several schemes for the updating energy-efficiency of housings.
